abstract: The extent and ecological significance of intraspecific diversity within
  marine microbial populations is still poorly understood, and it remains unclear
  if such strain-level microdiversity will affect fitness and persistence in a rapidly
  changing ocean environment. In this study, we cultured 11 sympatric strains of the
  ubiquitous marine picocyanobacterium Synechococcus isolated from a Narragansett
  Bay (Rhode Island, USA) phytoplankton community thermal selection experiment. Despite
  all 11 isolates being highly similar (with average nucleotide identities of textgreater99.9%,
  with 98.6-100% of the genome aligning), thermal performance curves revealed selection
  at warm and cool temperatures had subdivided the initial population into thermotypes
  with pronounced differences in maximum growth temperatures. Within the fine-scale
  genetic diversity that did exist within this population, the two divergent thermal
  ecotypes differed at a locus containing genes for the phycobilisome antenna complex.
  Our study demonstrates that present-day marine microbial populations can contain
  microdiversity in the form of cryptic but environmentally-relevant thermotypes that
  may increase their resilience to future rising temperatures.Competing Interest StatementThe
  authors have declared no competing interest.
