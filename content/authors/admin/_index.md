I am an microbial ecologist who derives stories from data. For my doctoral dissertation with <a href="https://web.uri.edu/rynearson-lab/">Dr. Tatiana Rynearson</a>, I examined the abiotic factors that shape phytoplankton communities. I employed experimental, molecular, and modeling approaches to investigate the role of temperature in driving phytoplankton physiology, community structure, and biogeography.
