Phytoplankton communities are influenced by a complex interplay of environmental variables. Temperature and nutrient concentration are two particularly important factors driving phytoplankton growth and composition, but are often investigated separately in the lab. This work investigated the individual and interactive effects of temperature and nutrient concentration on the composition and physiology of a phytoplankton community.
