title: Phytoplankton Composition and Productivity  
summary: Part of my dissertation involves work with both the <a href="https://nes-lter.whoi.edu">Northeast US Shelf Long-term Ecological Research Project</a> and the <a href="https://oceanexports.org">NASA EXPORTS</a> project. Within these projects, I have been examining temporal patterns of size-fractionated primary production and phytoplankton community composition.
